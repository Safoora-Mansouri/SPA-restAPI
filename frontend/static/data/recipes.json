I used canned ones.\nChop 4 large Chinese mushrooms into fine pieces too.\nAdd the water chestnuts and mushrooms to the pork mixture. Mix all the ingredients well to combine.\nFinely dice a small carrot. These will be placed on top each pork siew mai to garnish. Use salmon roe or salted egg yolk if preferred.\nSet aside the pork mixture and the diced carrots till ready to wrap dumplings.\n\nTo make the glutinous rice filling -\nSoak 2 lap cheongs (Chinese sausages) in boiling water until the skin is separated from the meat. Remove the skin from the lap cheong and cut them into small dices.\nIn a large sauce pan over medium-high heat, pan fry the lap cheong dices until they are golden but not brown. They should be a lovely red.\nFollow the instructions at Glutinous Rice in Lotus Leaf (http://cooking.storyofbing.com/2010/07/glutinous-rice-in-lotus-leaf-2/) and prepare the glutinous rice. Once the rice and other ingredients are stir fried till fragrant, add the pieces of fried lap cheong and set aside to cool.\n\nPrepare the ingredients necessary for the wrapping of the dumplings.\nStart by placing a sheet of wonton wrapper on a flat surface. Place a small teaspoon of filling in the centre of the wonton wrapper.\nDap finger in some water and gently wet the sides of the wonton wrapper.\nGather the wonton wrapper with the filling in the palm of hand and squeeze gently while folding the wrapper skin upwards and against the filling so that the wonton wrapper wraps the filling tightly.\nMake sure the dumplings are tight. Otherwise they may fall apart while being steamed. Use more water to seal them if necessary.\nPlace a large shrimp on the top of each pork siew mai.\nAdd a few pieces of chopped carrot or salmon roe or salted egg yolk to add a fresh colour to the dumpling.\nDo the same for the glutinous rice siew mai, adding more lap cheong pieces on the top if preferred.\nPlace the dumplings in a steamer lined with baking paper. Cut some holes through the baking paper to let the steam through.\nPlace the steamer over boiling water for 14-15 minutes or until the filling is cooked.\nServe hot.\nUncooked dumplings may be frozen and steamed at a later date. Dust some flour in a container so that the dumplings wont stick to it.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To prepare the pork filling -","ingredients":[{"id":10010219,"name":"pork","localizedName":"pork","image":"pork-tenderloin-raw.png"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":2,"step":"Mince 700g of pork and place them in a large mixing bowl.","ingredients":[{"id":0,"name":"ground meat","localizedName":"ground meat","image":"fresh-ground-beef.jpg"},{"id":10010219,"name":"pork","localizedName":"pork","image":"pork-tenderloin-raw.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":405907,"name":"mixing bowl","localizedName":"mixing bowl","image":"mixing-bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":3,"step":"Add 2 tablespoons of corn starch, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of ground white pepper,  1/2 teaspoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of Maggie Seasoning Sauce or Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons of Shaoxing Huatiao wine and 2 tablespoons of sesame oil.","ingredients":[{"id":6971,"name":"worcestershire sauce","localizedName":"worcestershire sauce","image":"dark-sauce.jpg"},{"id":2032,"name":"ground white pepper","localizedName":"ground white pepper","image":"white-pepper.png"},{"id":0,"name":"seasoning sauce","localizedName":"seasoning sauce","image":""},{"id":20027,"name":"corn starch","localizedName":"corn starch","image":"white-powder.jpg"},{"id":4058,"name":"sesame oil","localizedName":"sesame oil","image":"sesame-oil.png"},{"id":19335,"name":"sugar","localizedName":"sugar","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":14084,"name":"wine","localizedName":"wine","image":"red-wine.jpg"}],"equipment":[]},{"number":4,"step":"Roughly chop 80g of water chestnuts into fine pieces.

Set aside.</li><li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat shortening and granulated sugar on medium speed, about 2 minutes till fluffy.

Mold into a ball. Cut in half, and transfer one half to a second sheet of parchment. Cover both with a top sheet of parchment paper, and use the palm of your hand to press dough down into disks.  Roll out dough to 1/8th-inch thick.  I like to use my trusty rolling pin rings to do this. Transfer rolled out dough to a cutting board, or trays, and chill in fridge at least 2 hours until firm.</li><li>Preheat oven to 325F. Remove one sheet of dough from fridge, and peel off top sheet of parchment. Using a 1 -inch biscuit cutter cut out cookies.  Transfer to parchment lined baking tray, spacing cookies about 1-inch apart. You may want to use a frosting spatula to transfer the cookies. You should be able to fit about 24 cookies per baking tray.</li><li>Bake in center of the oven 10 minutes, till set. Transfer tray to cooling rack, and let cool on tray 5 minutes, before transferring cookies to cooling rack to cool to room temperature.  Repeat with remaining dough, gathering up scraps and re-rolling until youve used it all. I sometimes roll it out and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to get it to firm up again.</li><li>Once cookies have cooled to room temperature, dump them all into a freezer safe container, and stick them in the freezer, uncovered for about 30 minutes to chill.

Do not overcook, as chocolate burns easily. Remove from microwave, and stir till smooth. Add peppermint extract, and mix in well.</li><li>Remove a handful of the chocolate wafers from the freezer.  You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.
